gallifreyan.js
==============

Try the project running here: http://tiagopadua.com/gallifreyan/test/

This is a JavaScript library to draw words using the "gallifreyan" alphabet (used by the Time Lords, on the TV show Dr. Who).

The alphabet is not official - it was created by Â© Loren Sherman.
As the author points out, it is not a language. It's just a cool way to write english words.
